# Time Zone Calculator

This is a work in progress.

Ideally, this would be a tool to share times for events.

An organizer could share a link to the site using their timezone:
`https://.../?zone=5&time=1530`
where `zone` is the UTC value of their timezone and `time` is the time, in that timezone, as a 24h value. In this case, 3:30PM in UTC+5 --> zone=5 time=1530.

And then a guest to the event could go to the link to see the time localized for their timezone.
The site would also feature relevant textfields to generate a link on the index page.

As of writing this, the only features this has is being able to take the url parameters and display the time and UTC value... so not much so far.

This is not a priority for me, it has a bunch of recycled from my personal site, and is likely very disorganized and might stay that way. 

If you choose to fork this project, please remove any references to my personal site such that it does not appear as though your forked project and I are associated. Feel free to pull request.
